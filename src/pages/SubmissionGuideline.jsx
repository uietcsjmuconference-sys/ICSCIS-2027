        In line with our dedication to promoting innovation and upholding the
        highest standards of academic integrity, we request adherence to the
        following guidelines regarding the use of AI-generated content in paper
        submissions:
      </p>
      <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-3">
        <li>
          <strong>Originality:</strong> Authors are responsible for ensuring
          that all AI-generated content in their submissions is original and
          respects intellectual property rights. Any use of AI tools or datasets
          must be properly attributed. Plagiarism (excluding references) must be
          below 10%, and AI Detection percentage must be 0%.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accuracy and Validity:</strong> AI-generated content must be
          carefully assessed for accuracy and reliability. Authors bear the
          responsibility for ensuring the correctness of any AI-generated data,
          analysis, or conclusions included in their papers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Transparency:</strong> The application of AI tools and
          techniques in developing the submission should be transparently
          disclosed. This includes specifying the AI methods, models, and
          datasets used, along with any known limitations or biases they may
          carry.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ethical Considerations:</strong> Authors are expected to
          follow ethical guidelines in their use of AI. This includes refraining
          from using AI to fabricate data, create misleading information, or
          replicate existing work without proper attribution.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Review Process:</strong> The conference organizers reserve the
          right to closely examine AI-generated content during the review
          process. Submissions containing unverified or improperly attributed
          AI-generated material may face rejection. All submitted papers to the
          conference will undergo a double-blind review process to ensure fair
          review process.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Responsibility:</strong> Authors bear full responsibility for
          the content of their submissions, including any AI-generated elements.
          The conference organizers and reviewers hold no liability for any
          issues stemming from the use of AI in submitted papers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Length of Papers:</strong> The most common types of papers
          accepted for publication are full papers (12–15+ pages) and short
          papers (8-12 pages), where a page constitutes 300-400 words. Only
          papers of significant scientific content will be accepted. <strong>Very short
          papers (less than 6 pages) are not allowed.</strong>
        </li>
      </ol>
